 * @brief Creates a new software timer instance, and returns a handle

 * Application developer must provide the memory buffer sw_timer_buffer_t that will
 * get used by the software timer. Timer is created in the stopped state.
 * The sw_timer_start() API function can be used to transition a timer into
 * the running state.
 *
 * @param period The timer period. The time is defined in tick periods so the
 * macro SW_TIMER_CONV_MILLISECONDS_TO_TICKS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds and macro SW_TIMER_CONV_MICROSECONDS_TO_TICKS
 * can be used to convert a time that has been specified in microseconds.
 * For example, if the timer must expire after 100 ticks, then period should be
 * set to 100. Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500 milliseconds,
 * then period can be set to SW_TIMER_CONV_MILLISECONDS_TO_TICKS(500).
 *
 * @param mode If mode is set to SW_TIMER_MODE_REPEATING then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the period parameter. If mode is
 * set to SW_TIMER_MODE_SINGLE_SHOT then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the stopped state after it expires.
 *
 * @param callback The function to call when the timer expires.
 *
 * @param arg Argument for the callback function.
 *
 * @param sw_timer_buffer_t Must point to a variable of type sw_timer_t,
 * which is then used to hold the timerâ€™s state.
 *
 * @return The handle to the newly created timer.
 *
 * @note Make sure that the interrupt cannot occur during the execution
 * of this function. Needs disable the interrupt service routine in the
 * main function before using this function.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 * void callback_func( void )
 * {
 * }
 *
 * void main( void )
 * {
 *	// Return status code for software timer
 *	sw_timer_status_t status;

 *	// Memory static allocation for software timer
 *	sw_timer_buffer_t sw_timer_buffer;
